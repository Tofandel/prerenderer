## About prerenderer

The goal of this package is to provide a simple, framework-agnostic prerendering solution that is easily extensible and usable for any site or single-page-app.

[prerenderer-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/tribex/prerenderer-webpack-plugin) is now deprecated, but still functional. It will be replaced by [prerender-spa-plugin](https://github.com/chrisvfritz/prerender-spa-plugin) v3 in the near future.

Now, if you're not familiar with the concept of *prerendering*, you might predictably ask...

## What is Prerendering?

Recently, SSR (Server Side Rendering) has taken the JavaScript front-end world by storm. The fact that you can now render your sites and apps on the server before sending them to your clients is an absolutely *revolutionary* idea (and totally not what everyone was doing before JS client-side apps got popular in the first place...)

However, the same criticisms that were valid for PHP, ASP, JSP, (and such) sites are valid for server-side rendering today. It's slow, breaks fairly easily, and is difficult to implement properly.

Thing is, despite what everyone might be telling you, you probably don't *need* SSR. You can get almost all the advantages of it (without the disadvantages) by using **prerendering.** Prerendering is basically firing up a headless browser, loading your app's routes, and saving the results to a static HTML file. You can then serve it with whatever static-file-serving solution you were using previously. It *just works* with HTML5 navigation and the likes. No need to change your code or add server-side rendering workarounds.

In the interest of transparency, there are some use-cases where prerendering might not be a great idea.

- **Tons of routes** - If your site has hundreds or thousands of routes, prerendering will be really slow. Sure you only have to do it once per update, but it could take ages. Most people don't end up with thousands of static routes, but just in-case...
- **Dynamic Content** - If your render routes that have content that's specific to the user viewing it or other dynamic sources, you should make sure you have placeholder components that can display until the dynamic content loads on the client-side. Otherwise it might be a tad weird.

## Example `prerenderer` Usage

(It's much simpler if you use `prerenderer` with [webpack](https://github.com/tribex/prerenderer-webpack-plugin) or another build system.)

**Input**
```
app/
├── index.html
└── index.js // Whatever JS controls the SPA, loaded by index.html
```

**Output**
```
app/
├── about
│   └── index.html // Static rendered /about route.
├── index.html // Static rendered / route.
├── index.js // Whatever JS controls the SPA, loaded by index.html
└── some
    └── deep
        └── nested
            └── route
                └── index.html // Static rendered nested route.
```

```js
const fs = require('fs')
const path = require('path')
const mkdirp = require('mkdirp')
const Prerenderer = require('@prerenderer/prerenderer')
// Make sure you install a renderer as well!
const JSDOMRenderer = require('@prerenderer/renderer-jsdom')

const prerenderer = new Prerenderer({
  // Required - The path to the app to prerender. Should have an index.html and any other needed assets.
  staticDir: path.join(__dirname, 'app'),
  // The plugin that actually renders the page.
  renderer: new JSDOMRenderer()
})

// Initialize is separate from the constructor for flexibility of integration with build systems.
prerenderer.initialize()
.then(() => {
  // List of routes to render.
  return prerenderer.renderRoutes([ '/', '/about', '/some/deep/nested/route' ])
})
.then(renderedRoutes => {
  // renderedRoutes is an array of objects in the format:
  // {
  //   route: String (The route rendered)
  //   html: String (The resulting HTML)
  // }
  renderedRoutes.forEach(renderedRoute => {
    try {
      // A smarter implementation would be required, but this does okay for an example.
      // Don't copy this directly!!!
      const outputDir = path.join(__dirname, 'app', renderedRoute.route)
      const outputFile = `${outputDir}/index.html`

      mkdirp.sync(outputDir)
      fs.writeFileSync(outputFile, renderedRoute.html.trim())
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle errors.
    }
  })

  // Shut down the file server and renderer.
  prerenderer.destroy()
})
.catch(err => {
  // Shut down the server and renderer.
  prerenderer.destroy()
  // Handle errors.
})
```

## Available Renderers
- `@prerenderer/renderer-jsdom` - Uses [jsdom](https://npmjs.com/package/jsdom). Extremely fast, but unreliable and cannot handle advanced usages. May not work with all front-end frameworks and apps.
- `@prerenderer/renderer-puppeteer` - Uses [puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) to render pages in headless Chrome. Simpler and more reliable than the previous `ChromeRenderer`.

## Removed in `prerenderer 0.6.0`:
- `prerenderer.BrowserRenderer` - Opens the system default browser to render the page. (Use `@prerenderer/renderer-jsdom` or `@prerenderer/renderer-puppeteer` instead.)
- `prerenderer.ChromeRenderer` - Uses Google Chrome in headless mode over RDP.  (Use `@prerenderer/renderer-puppeteer` instead.)


### Which renderer should I use?

**Use `@prerenderer/renderer-puppeteer` if:** You're prerendering up to a couple hundred pages (bye-bye RAM!).

**Use `@prerenderer/renderer-jsdom` if:** You need to prerender thousands upon thousands of pages, but quality isn't all that important, and you're willing to work around issues for more advanced cases. (Programmatic SVG support, etc.)

### Prerenderer Methods

- `constructor(options: Object)` - Creates a Prerenderer instance and sets up the renderer and server objects.
- `initialize(): Promise<>` - Starts the static file server and renderer instance (where appropriate).
- `getOptions(): Object` - Returns the options used to configure `prerenderer`
- `getServer(): (Internal Server Class)` - Gets the instanced server class. **INTERNAL**
- `getRenderer(): (Instanced Renderer Class)` - Gets the instanced renderer class. **INTERNAL**
- `modifyServer(Server: Server Instance, stage: string)` - **DANGEROUS** Called by the server to allow renderers to modify the server at various stages. Avoid if at all possible. **INTERNAL**
- `destroy()` - Destroys the static file server and renderer, freeing the resources.
- `renderRoutes(routes: Array<String>): Promise<Array<RenderedRoute>>` - Renders set of routes. Returns a promise resolving to an array of rendered routes in the form of:

```js
[
  {
    route: '/route/path', // The route path.
    html: '<!DOCTYPE html><html>...</html>' // The prerendered HTML for the route
  },
  ...
]
```

## Caveats

- For obvious reasons, `prerenderer` only works for SPAs that route using the HTML5 history API. `index.html#/hash/route` URLs will unfortunately not work.
- Whatever client-side rendering library you're using should be able to at least replace any server-rendered content or diff with it.
  - For **Vue.js 1** use [`replace: false`](http://vuejs.org/api/#replace) on root components.
  - For **Vue.js 2**  Ensure your root component has the same id as the prerendered element it's replacing. Otherwise you'll end up with duplicated content.
